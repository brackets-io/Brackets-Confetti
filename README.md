Variables
---------

* shakeIntensity - Screenshake amount
* confettiAmount - Number of confetti particles per character
* gravity - Makes confetti fall

Edit these at the top of main.js

You can also edit the 'z-index' in main.less to make the particles appear above the text. Some themes may mess with the z-index of the editor so if the confetti doesnt appear try changing that value.
